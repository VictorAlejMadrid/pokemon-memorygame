# ⚡Pokemon Memory Game!⚡

This is a classic pokemon themed memory game in React!

## Objective

This is a challenge project for learning the basics of React, their components behavior and an UI/UX challenge for learning animations and styling.

## Process

This project was harder than I expected it to be, it was very challenging to get the animations right and I had to solve many bugs during its development.

Even though, this project was very rewarding to get it done, it feels amazing to play something that I made and had some difficulties in making.

I feel very proud of creating this project so early in my career.

## Thanks

Thanks Vortigo Digital and Julia Eileen for providing such a fun and enrichment challenge to my career.
